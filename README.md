# File Encrypter/Decrypter Program

This program is a simple tool for encrypting and decrypting text files using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. It's designed as an educational project to demonstrate basic file manipulation and encryption techniques.

## Features:

- Encrypts plain text files with a user-provided secret key.
- Decrypts encrypted files using the corresponding secret key.
- User-friendly interface for easy interaction.
- Error handling for invalid inputs.

## Security Considerations:

This program utilizes the Caesar Cipher, a simple encryption method with well-known weaknesses. It's not intended for high-security applications.

## Getting Started:

1. Clone or download the project repository.
2. Ensure you have a C compiler installed (e.g., GCC).
3. Compile the C code (`caesar.c`) using the C compiler.
4. Run the compiled program, ensuring the necessary files are in the correct location.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions for encryption or decryption.

## Code Structure:

The program is implemented entirely in C. It handles user interaction, file I/O, error handling, and the core encryption and decryption algorithms within the same C codebase.

## Learning Outcomes:

This project provides a practical introduction to:

- Basic file I/O operations in C.
- Implementing encryption and decryption algorithms in C.
- Understanding the Caesar Cipher algorithm and its limitations.
