# File Encrypter/Decrypter Program

This program is a simple tool for encrypting and decrypting text files using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. It's designed as an educational project to demonstrate basic file manipulation and encryption techniques.

# Features:

- Encrypts plain text files with a user-provided secret key.
- Decrypts encrypted files using the corresponding secret key.
- User-friendly interface for easy interaction.
- Error handling for invalid inputs.

# Security Considerations:

This program utilizes the Caesar Cipher, a simple encryption method with well-known weaknesses. It's not intended for high-security applications.

# Getting Started:

1. Clone or download the project repository.
2. Ensure you have Python 3 and necessary libraries installed (details provided in 'Requirements.txt').
3. Run the program using python `main.py`.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions for encryption or decryption.

# Code Structure:

The code is well-commented and organized into functions for readability.

# Learning Outcomes:

This project provides a practical introduction to:

- Basic file I/O operations in Python.
- The concept of encryption and decryption.
- The Caesar Cipher algorithm and its limitations.

# Authors
- Andrew Sliva

# Further Exploration:
Explore more advanced encryption algorithms and libraries.
Implement unit tests for the program's functionality.
Feel free to contribute or modify the code for further learning!
