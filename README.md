# File Encrypter/Decrypter Program

This program is a simple tool for encrypting and decrypting text files using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. It's designed as an educational project to demonstrate basic file manipulation and encryption techniques.

# Features:

- Encrypts plain text files with a user-provided secret key.
- Decrypts encrypted files using the corresponding secret key.
- User-friendly interface for easy interaction.
- Error handling for invalid inputs.

# Security Considerations:

This program utilizes the Caesar Cipher, a simple encryption method with well-known weaknesses. It's not intended for high-security applications.

# Getting Started:

1. Clone or download the project repository.
2. Ensure you have Python 3 and necessary libraries installed (details provided in 'Requirements.txt').
3. Compile the C code using a C compiler (e.g., GCC).
4. Run the program using Python (`main.py`), ensuring the compiled C code is in the correct location.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions for encryption or decryption.

# Code Structure:

The Python code handles user interaction, file I/O, and error handling, while the core encryption and decryption algorithms are implemented in C for efficiency. The C code is compiled separately and invoked from Python as needed.

# Learning Outcomes:

This project provides a practical introduction to:

- Basic file I/O operations in Python.
- Interfacing Python with C for enhanced performance.
- The concept of encryption and decryption.
- The Caesar Cipher algorithm and its limitations.
